    Numbered display equation (9.1) from MVSML chapter 9.

    Formula: Fig. 9.1 Hyperplanes in two (left) and three (right) dimensions two-dimensional subspace. Although it is hard to visualize a hyperplane when the original space has a dimension of four or more, it still applies for the ( p + 1)- dimensional ﬂat subspace (James et al. 2013). In higher dimensions, it is useful to think of a hyperplane as a member of an afﬁne family of ( p + 1)-dimensional subspaces (afﬁne spaces look and behave very similarly to linear spaces without the requirement to contain the origin), such that the whole space is partitioned into these family subspaces. From a mathematical point of view, a hyperplane is deﬁned as (James et al. 2013) \beta0 + \beta1X1 + \beta2X2 + \beta3X3 = 0
