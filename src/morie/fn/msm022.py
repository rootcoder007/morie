    Numbered display equation (5.3) from MVSML chapter 5.

    Formula: types are in the four environments. Besides the line indicator (GID), environment information (Env) was also available in the data set, which was needed for implementing model (5.4). The adopted structure for the variance–covariance matrix between environments is \SigmaE = \sigma2 EGII and the resulting model is referred to as M2. Another explored model (M20) was obtained under the same speciﬁcation, with the difference that G was set equal to the identity matrix. Using the same validation scheme that was used in Example 1, the results for each of the 10 random partitions are shown in Table 5.2, in which, for illustrative purposes, model
