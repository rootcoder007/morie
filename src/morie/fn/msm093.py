    Numbered display equation (7.3) from MVSML chapter 7.

    Formula: . , C, where L = (L1, . . ., Ln)T = XE\betaE + X\beta + XEM\betaEM + e is the vector with latent random variables of all observations, e  Nn(0, In) is a random error vector, XE, X, and XEM are the design matrices of the environments, markers, and environment–marker interactions, respectively, while \betaE and \betaEM are the vectors of the environment effects and the interaction effects, respectively, with a prior distribution that can be speciﬁed as was done for \beta. In fact, with the BGLR function, it is also possible to implement all these extensions, since it allows using any of the several priors included here: FIXED, BRR, BayesA, BayesB, BayesC, and BL. For example, the basic BGLR code to implement model
