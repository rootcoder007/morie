    SIS boundary uncertainty simulation

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, optional
        Observed values at sample locations.
    coords : array-like, optional
        Coordinates of sample locations, shape (n, 2) or (n, 3).
    n : int
        Number of simulation nodes or grid points (default 100).
    seed : int
        Random seed for reproducibility (default 42).
    **kwargs
        Additional method-specific parameters.
