# US lead-service-line historical regulatory milestones:
#   pre-1900: lead pipes common; no regulation
#   1900-1940: peak lead-pipe installation era
#   1940-1960: transition toward copper + galvanized
#   1960-1986: copper dominant; local lead bans patchy
#   1986: Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments BAN on lead solder,
#         lead-free pipe requirement in federal law
#   2011: Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act -- tightened to
#         ≤ 0.25% weighted lead content for "lead-free"
#
# Canadian context (Ontario):
#   pre-1950: lead service lines common in Toronto, Hamilton, London
#   1950-1975: transition period
#   1975-2000: local bans
#   2007+: federal and provincial remediation programs
#
# The function returns a risk category based on year of construction.
# This is SCREENING ONLY -- actual pipe material must be confirmed
# by in-home inspection or municipal service-line database.

    """Screen for lead-service-line risk by building construction year.

    Year-based heuristic for plumbing lead risk, calibrated to US and
    Canadian regulatory milestones. Returns per-building probability
    and a categorical risk band. **This is screening only -- confirm
    with in-home inspection or municipal service-line records before
    using for health intervention.**

    US milestones encoded:

    - 1986 SDWA Amendments: banned lead solder, required "lead-free"
      pipes.
    - 2011 Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act: tightened
      "lead-free" to ≤ 0.25% weighted lead content.

    Canadian milestones:

    - Pre-1950 Ontario: lead service lines common in Toronto/Hamilton.
    - 1975–1999: local bans; patchy replacement.
    - 2007+: federal remediation pressure.

    Parameters
    ----------
    construction_year : int or array-like
        Year(s) of building / service-line installation.
    country : {"us", "ca"}, default "us"
        Which regulatory timeline to apply.
    with_intervals : bool, default False
        If True, include the band boundary years and source notes
        in extra.

    Returns
    -------
    DescriptiveResult
        value = mean lead-pipe probability across inputs.
        extra has per-building label + probability, distribution by
        band, and citation.

    Examples
    --------
    A 1920 Detroit rowhouse: very-high risk

    >>> r = lead_service_line_risk(1920, country="us")
    >>> r.extra["label"]
    'very_high'
    >>> r.value
    0.85

    A 2015 Toronto new-build: low

    >>> r = lead_service_line_risk(2015, country="ca")
    >>> r.extra["label"]
    'low'

    Notes
    -----
    Quote: "The pipes below remember what the pipes above forgot."

    This function is deliberately simple because the real answer
    depends on data we don't have here (utility service-line
    inventory, actual tap sampling). A year-based screen is a
    legitimate first pass for triaging *where* to look.
