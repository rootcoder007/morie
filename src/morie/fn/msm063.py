    Numbered display equation (6.7) from MVSML chapter 6.

    Formula: (6.6) where XE and XEM are the design matrices of the environments and environment– marker interactions, respectively, while \betaE and \betaEM are the vectors of the environ- ment effects and the interaction effects, respectively, with a prior distribution that can be speciﬁed as was done for \beta. Indeed, with the BGLR function all these things are possible, and all the options described before can also be adopted for the rest of effects added in the model: FIXED, BRR, BayesA, BayesB, BayesC, and BL. Under the RKHS model with genotypic and environment–genotypic interaction effects, in the predictor, the modiﬁed model (6.6) is expressed as Y = 1n\mu + XE\betaE + ZLg + ZELgE + e,

    Parameters

    where : array-like
        Input data.
