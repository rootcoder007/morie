    Numbered display equation (9.34) from MVSML chapter 9.

    Formula: for choosing the right hyperplane, we need to ﬁnd: (a) a balance between the limit of the total amount of slack due to outliers, measured as Pn i=1\zetai and (b) a hyperplane with a large margin, but if the margin is larger, more outliers are possible, which implies a larger amount of slack. The optimization problem now consists of ﬁnding a hyperplane that is able to classify most of the training observations in the two classes; this can be accomplished by obtaining the solution to the following optimi- zation problem: maximize M

    Parameters
