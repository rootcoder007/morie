    CentralTendency expression involving 'possibilities' (auto-extracted; see reference for full context).

    Formula: been added to the equation to give it a form such as y = x – x2 or y = x + x2.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like
        Input data.

    Returns
    -------
    result : RichResult
        Inherits from ``dict`` (so ``isinstance(result, dict)`` is True
        and ``result["statistic"]`` / ``result.get(...)`` keep working),
        but also exposes a multi-section ``str(result)`` render. Keys: value.
        See ``morie.fn.describe('ca3u55')`` for the full guide.
