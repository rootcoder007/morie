    Numbered display equation (14.11) from MVSML chapter 14.

    Formula: accuracy of this with the non-penalized functional regression described in the previous section, 100 random partitions were used, and in each, 80% of the data set was used to train the model and the rest to evaluate the prediction performance. When training the model, an inner ﬁve-fold cross-validation was used to choose the optimal parameter (\lambda) and estimate the \betal’s coefﬁcients. This was done using Fourier and B-spline basis in the representation of the beta function, and in both cases, two 602 14 Functional Regression basis were used. In both cases, the penalty matrix
