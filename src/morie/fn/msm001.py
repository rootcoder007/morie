    Numbered display equation (1.1) from MVSML chapter 1.

    Formula: A model is a simpliﬁed description, using mathematical tools, of the processes we think that give rise to the observations in a set of data. A model is deterministic if it explains (completely) the dependent variables based on the independent ones. In many real-world scenarios, this is not possible. Instead, statistical (or stochastic) models try to approximate exact solutions by evaluating probabilistic distributions. For this reason, a statistical model is expressed by an equation composed of a systematic (deterministic) and a random part (Stroup 2012) as given in the next equation: yi = f xi ( ) + Ei, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n,
