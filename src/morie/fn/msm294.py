    Numbered display equation (14.13) from MVSML chapter 14.

    Formula: (14.13) where XE is the design matrix of the environments and \betaE is the vector with the environment effects, and the Bayesian formulation can be completed by assuming a prior distribution for \betaE. As was described in Chap. 6 in the BGLR package, there are several options for this: FIXED, BRR, BayesA, BayesB, BayesC, and BL. In the next example, the ﬁrst one is used. Example 14.6 This is a continuation of Example 14.5 used to illustrate the performance when adding environmental information to the prediction task by using the Bayesian formulation

    Parameters
    ----------
    where : array-like
        Input data.
    XE : array-like
        Input data.
    the : array-like

    design : array-like
        Input data.
    matrix : array-like
        Input data.
    of : array-like
        Input data.
