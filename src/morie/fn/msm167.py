    Numbered display equation (9.2) from MVSML chapter 9.

    Formula: X3 )T for which (9.1) holds is a point in the hyperplane. Equation (9.1) is the equation of a plane, since in three dimensions, as mentioned before, a hyperplane is a plane, as can be observed in Fig. 9.1 (right). For the p-dimensional space, the dimension of the hyperplane generated is p + 1, and it is simply an extension of (9.1) as \beta0 + \beta1X1 + \beta2X2 + . . . + \betapXp = 0 (9.2) In the same way, any point X = (X1, X2, . . . . Xp )T in the p-dimensional space that satisﬁes (9.2) deﬁnes a ( p + 1)-dimensional hyperplane, which means that the hyperplane is formed by those points of X that satisfy
