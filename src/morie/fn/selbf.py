    Quantify selection bias as a multiplicative factor.

    When selection into a study depends on both treatment and outcome,
    the bias factor approximates the ratio by which the naive estimate
    is inflated.

    .. math::

        BF = \\frac{1}{1 - (1 - P_s) \\cdot \\Delta}

    where :math:`P_s` is the selection probability and :math:`\\Delta` is
    the difference in selection rates by outcome status.

    :param p_selected: Overall probability of selection into the sample, (0, 1].
    :param outcome_diff: Difference in selection probabilities between
        outcome groups (absolute value).
    :return: DescriptiveResult with bias factor.
    :raises ValueError: If parameters out of range.
