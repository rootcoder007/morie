    Probability equation extracted from Cahoon, Hinich & Ordeshook (1978) Analyzing Spatial Models of Choice and Judgment.

    Formula: Pi jy = Φ β jf xi − α j                              (6.40)

    Parameters
    ----------
    x : array-like
        Input data.

    Returns
    -------
    result : RichResult
        Inherits from ``dict`` (so ``isinstance(result, dict)`` is True
        and ``result["statistic"]`` / ``result.get(...)`` keep working),
        but also exposes a multi-section ``str(result)`` render. Keys: value.
        See ``morie.fn.describe('analyzing_spatial_models_of_choice_and_judgment6e40')`` for the full guide.
