    r"""
    Numbered display equation (8.3) from MVSML chapter 8.

    Formula: needs to be symmetric and positive semi-deﬁnite, the term \betaTK\beta is an empirical RKHS norm with regard to the training data, \lambda is a smoothing or regularization parameter that should be positive and should control the trade-off between model goodness of ﬁt and complexity, and the factor 1 2 is introduced for convenience. The second term of (8.3) acts as a penalization term that is added to the minus log-likelihood. The goal is to ﬁnd \eta0 and \beta, which is equivalent to ﬁnding f xi ( ) = \eta0 + kT i \beta that minimizes
