    Numbered display equation (14.14) from MVSML chapter 14.

    Formula: ance of the model with no interaction term (model 14.13). We can observe that by adding the interaction of environment with the functional covariate, both Bayesian models (PBFR and BFR) resulted in a reduction on average of about 35% of the MSE (PBFR (14.13) vs. PBFR (14.14) and BFR (14.13) vs. BFR (14.14)), and again the Bayesian model without penalization matrix was better (0.2955 vs. 0.2899) Table 14.3 Mean squared error of prediction (MSE) for 100 random partitions for Fourier and B-spline representations, where PBFR (14.13) and BFR (14.13) are MSE of the model (14.13) with and without penalization matrix based on the ﬁrst derivative in the functional term (X\beta), and PBFR (14.14) and BFR
