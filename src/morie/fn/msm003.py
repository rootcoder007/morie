    Numbered display equation (1.3) from MVSML chapter 1.

    Formula: environment, which can be attributed to the fact that this model ignores the envi- ronmental effect and was only ﬁtted as a single-mean model, which implies that the environmental effects are included in the residuals. For this reason, we then incor- porated the environmental effect in the model as a separate effect. This ﬁxed-effects model is equal to a one-way classiﬁcation model as 16 1 General Elements of Genomic Selection and Statistical Learning GYij = \betai + eij, i = 1, ::, 5, j = 1, 2, 3,
