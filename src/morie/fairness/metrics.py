"""Group-disparity metrics for auditing classification and risk-scoring
systems.

Every callable here is an *audit* measure: given the decisions a system
made (and, where available, the realised ground truth) plus a protected
attribute such as race, it quantifies whether outcomes differ across
groups.  None of these functions make predictions; they only measure
disparity in predictions that already exist.

The five metrics are the classical group-fairness suite used in the
algorithmic-fairness literature:

* :func:`fairness_disparate_impact` — the four-fifths rule.
* :func:`fairness_demographic_parity` — favourable-rate gap.
* :func:`fairness_equalized_odds` — TPR/FPR gaps (needs ground truth).
* :func:`fairness_average_odds_difference` — mean TPR+FPR gap.
* :func:`fairness_gini` — concentration of a score distribution.

Each returns a :class:`~morie.fn._richresult.RichResult` with a
paragraph-level summary, a per-group table, and a plain-language
interpretation.

    The Gini coefficient ranges from 0 (every value identical, perfect
    equality) to nearly 1 (one unit holds everything).  Applied to risk
    scores, patrol counts, or stop counts, it measures how unequally a
    predictive-policing system *concentrates* its attention.  When a
    ``group`` is supplied, a per-group Gini is also reported, exposing
    whether the concentration is itself uneven across groups.

        Non-negative quantities (risk scores, counts, …).
    group : array-like, optional

    ``BAS = Δ_parity × G``, where ``Δ_parity`` is the demographic parity
