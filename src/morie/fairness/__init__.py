"""morie.fairness — group-disparity audit toolkit.

A subsystem for *auditing* risk-assessment, recidivism, and
predictive-policing systems for racial (and other protected-attribute)
disparities.  morie does not deploy such systems — it measures whether
an existing one encodes disparate treatment, so that researchers,
oversight bodies, and the public can hold those systems accountable.

Phase A ships the disparity-metrics core
(:mod:`morie.fairness.metrics`): classical group-fairness measures —
disparate impact, demographic parity, equalised odds, average odds
difference, and the Gini coefficient — each returning a rich,
paragraph-level :class:`~morie.fn._richresult.RichResult`.

Later phases add the generalised predictive-policing audit module, the
multi-city temporal analysis, the JAX simulation framework, and the
explainability (XAI) layer.
