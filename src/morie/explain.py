"""morie.explain — human-readable descriptions of module-output CSVs.

Backs ``morie explain <filename>`` and ``morie cheatsheet``.

The explanations here are written for someone who has just run
``morie run-module <name>`` for the first time and is staring at a
folder of 10-15 CSVs not knowing where to start.  They describe:

  * what question the file answers,
  * how to read each column,
  * which row / cell to look at first.

Adding a new module's output files means adding entries here.

    # ─── power-design outputs ───────────────────────────────────────────
    "power_summary.csv": """
Question this file answers: "What were the design assumptions for my
power analysis, and what's the recommended sample size at a glance?"

It's a one-row summary.  Read across; columns include:
  - effect_size          The minimum effect you said you want to detect
  - alpha                False-positive rate (typically 0.05)
  - power                True-positive rate (typically 0.80)
  - n_recommended        Per-group sample size to hit (power, effect) at alpha

If you want detail beyond the summary row, see the companion files
listed in `power_two_proportion_gender.csv` (two-proportion grid) and
`power_one_proportion_grid.csv` (one-proportion grid).
""".strip(),
    "power_two_proportion_gender.csv": """
Question this file answers: "How many participants per gender group
do I need to detect an effect of size X?"

Read each row: pick the effect_size you want to detect; the row tells
you the per-group sample size needed.

Columns:
  - effect_size          The difference in proportions you want to detect
                         (e.g. 0.05 = a 5 percentage-point gap between
                          men and women)
  - n_per_group          Number of participants per group required
  - power                Achieved power at this n (should match your design)
  - assumed_baseline     The baseline proportion the calculation uses

Typical usage: scroll to the row matching your hypothesised effect, read
n_per_group, double it for total sample.
""".strip(),
    "power_one_proportion_grid.csv": """
Same idea as power_two_proportion_gender.csv, but for a single-proportion
design (one group, no comparison): "What's the smallest deviation from
a null proportion p0 I can detect with n participants at alpha=0.05?"

Pick a row by n; read effect_size for the smallest detectable difference.
""".strip(),
    "power_ebac_endpoint_anchors.csv": """
Power-analysis grid specific to alcohol-impairment endpoints (eBAC =
estimated blood alcohol concentration).  Each row is one anchor point:
"if your endpoint is ebac_tot > 0.08 vs <= 0.08, what's the sample size?"
""".strip(),
    "power_gpower_reference_two_group.csv": """
Cross-reference: matches morie's two-group power numbers to G*Power
(the gold-standard reference tool).  If you're submitting to a journal
that demands G*Power, this is the table to cite.
""".strip(),
    "power_interaction_assumptions.csv": """
Assumptions used by the interaction-effect (e.g. gender × age) power
calculation.  Read this if you want to know what the interaction model
assumed before trusting power_interaction_pairwise_details.csv.
""".strip(),
    "power_interaction_feasibility_flags.csv": """
Flags for whether each proposed interaction cell is feasible at the
target sample size.  TRUE = enough data expected, FALSE = under-powered.
""".strip(),
    "power_interaction_group_allocations.csv": """
How the total sample is split across interaction cells (e.g. men 18-24,
men 25-44, women 18-24, women 25-44).  Tells you the per-cell n.
""".strip(),
    "power_interaction_imbalance_penalty.csv": """
The penalty to power introduced by unequal cell sizes.  If allocations
in power_interaction_group_allocations are skewed, this quantifies how
much power you lose vs. a balanced design.
""".strip(),
    "power_interaction_pairwise_details.csv": """
The detail backing power_interaction_assumptions.  Pairwise effect sizes
for each combination of interaction levels.
""".strip(),
    "power_interaction_sample_size_targets.csv": """
The sample-size *targets* (per cell) to hit your desired power for each
interaction comparison.  Compare to your actual allocations file.
""".strip(),
    "randomization_block_blueprints.csv": """
Pre-baked randomization-scheme blueprints (block sizes, stratification
factors).  Pick one and the *_example CSVs show what the resulting
allocation looks like.
""".strip(),
    "randomization_schedule_example_heavy_drinking_30d.csv": """
A *worked-example* randomization schedule using heavy-drinking-30-day as
the stratifying outcome.  Shows the participant id → arm assignment
table; useful for replicating in your own survey software.

Worked-example randomization schedule stratified by ebac_tot (the
total-impairment blood-alcohol-concentration endpoint).

    "data_na_summary.csv": """
Per-column missingness summary.  Each row is one input column; columns
include n_missing, pct_missing.  Read this BEFORE running any inference
module — fields with high missingness need imputation or exclusion.
""".strip(),
    "data_wrangling_log.csv": """
Step-by-step log of what the data-wrangling module did to your input
(renames, coercions, dropped rows).  Useful for the methods section.

Survey-weighted binomial summaries (e.g. heavy_drinking_30d prevalence)
